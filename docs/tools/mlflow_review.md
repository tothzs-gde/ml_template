## Features

### Experiment tracking

MLflow Tracking provides comprehensive experiment logging, parameter tracking, metrics visualization, and artifact management.

- **Experiment Organization**: Track and compare multiple model experiments
- **Metric Visualization**: Built-in plots and charts for model performance
- **Artifact Storage**: Store models, plots, and other files with each run
- **Collaboration**: Share experiments and results across teams

### Model registry

MLflow Model Registry provides centralized model versioning, stage management, and model lineage tracking.

- **Version Control**: Track model versions with automatic lineage
- **Stage Management**: Promote models through staging, production, and archived stages
- **Collaboration**: Team-based model review and approval workflows
- **Model Discovery**: Search and discover models across your organization

### Model deployment

MLflow Deployment supports multiple deployment targets including REST APIs, cloud platforms, and edge devices.

- **Multiple Targets**: Deploy to local servers, cloud platforms, or containerized - enronments
- **Model Serving**: Built-in REST API serving with automatic input validation
- **Batch Inference**: Support for batch scoring and offline predictions
- **Production Ready**: Scalable deployment options for enterprise use

## Pricing

Free and open-source for self-hosting.

## Pros

- Supports a wide variety of machine learning frameworks and libraries (TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-Learn, etc.)
- Centralized model registry for versioning, tracking, and deployment of models.
- Reproducibility and experiment tracking capabilities make it ideal for collaborative data science workflows.
- Supports deployment in multiple environments, including cloud-based solutions (AWS, Azure, etc.).
- Easy-to-use web UI and CLI, providing a flexible user experience.

## Cons

- Setting up the full stack for an enterprise-scale deployment (e.g., with MLflow Models, MLflow Pipelines, etc.) may require additional configuration and resources.
