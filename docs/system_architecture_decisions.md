# System Architecture Decisions

This document records the decisions made in relation to the project.

## Guide

Fill out the following sections under each component:

1. **Platform type**: [on-prem, cloud/custom, cloud/off-the-shelf]

Assuming we are using MLflow, its tracking service can be hosted for example on-prem, on AWS (cloud/custom) or could be provided by Databricks (cloud/off-the-shelf).

2. **Name of the solution**

This could be a custom tool written by us, an open source software like MLflow or some other product like DynamoDB

3. **Reason**

It is the best to highlight if there is anything that satisfied some non-negotiable requirement, or benefits over using different solution. Writing "This is what the team is familiar with; therefore, it would be the easiest to develop and maintain." is also a valid reason
